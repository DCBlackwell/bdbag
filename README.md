BDDS BigDataBag Utilities

The bdbag utilities are a collection of software programs for working with bagit packages that conform the BDDS Bagit/RO profile.

These utilities combine various other components such as the BDDS fork of the [Bagit-Python](https://github.com/ini-bdds/bagit-python) bag creation utility and the BDDS [MinID](https://github.com/ini-bdds/minid) client component into a single, easy to use software package.

Enhanced bag support includes:

* Automatic file retrieval based on the contents of a bag's fetch.txt file with multiple protocol support.
* Automatic minid creation and resolution for bags and bag contents.
* Default bags created with Bagit/RO profile compatibility.
